            <h1>Harvesting the Cherries</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Every great espresso begins in the coffee fields, where ripe coffee “cherries” are hand-picked at
                the peak of maturity. Pickers move methodically down rows of trees, selecting only the bright red
                cherries that guarantee sweetness and balance. This selective hand-harvest preserves the quality
                of the crop and ensures consistency from tree to cup.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Processing and Drying</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once harvested, the cherries must be processed within 24 hours. In the washed process,
                the outer pulp is removed by machine, leaving the beans coated in a thin mucilage.
                They’re then fermented in water tanks for 12–48 hours to break down any remaining sugary layer.
                Following fermentation, the beans are carefully washed and spread out on raised beds or patios to
                dry under the sun, often being raked or turned regularly to ensure uniform moisture removal.
                This can take up to two weeks, depending on weather.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Hulling and Sorting</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                After reaching the ideal moisture level (around 12%), the dried “parchment” beans are
                hulled—removing the dried husk and parchment layer—revealing the green coffee beans.
                Advanced optical sorters and density tables then separate out any defects or under-developed beans.
                Quality control at this stage is critical: uniform bean size and density lead to more even roasting.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Roasting</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Green beans arrive at the roastery ready for their transformative heat treatment.
                Master roasters develop precise profiles—temperature and time curves—to coax out each bean’s
                unique aroma and flavor notes (from bright citrus to dark chocolate). During roasting, beans
                undergo the “first crack” (expanding and melting sugars) and, if taken further, the “second crack”
                (developing deeper caramelization and body). For espresso, many roasters choose a medium‐to‐dark
                roast that balances acidity, sweetness, and crema production.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Grinding</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Freshly roasted beans are ground immediately before extraction to preserve volatile aromatics.
                Espresso demands an extremely fine, uniform grind—almost powdery—to maximize surface area under
                high‐pressure water. Small adjustments to grind size allow baristas to tweak flow rate and
                extraction time, dialing in the perfect balance of strength and sweetness.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Tamping and Extraction</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                The measured dose of ground coffee is distributed evenly into a metal portafilter basket and
                tamped down with consistent pressure to form a compact “puck.” The portafilter locks into the
                espresso machine’s group head. Pressurized hot water (around 90–95 °C, at 9 bar of pressure)
                is forced through the puck for about 25–30 seconds. During this time, water extracts oils, acids,
                and soluble solids, producing a concentrated, velvety shot topped with a golden layer of crema—the
                hallmark of a well‐pulled espresso.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h1>Serving</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Finally, the espresso is poured into a pre-warmed cup to maintain temperature.
                A properly brewed shot will exhibit a rich aroma, a harmonious blend of sweetness and
                complexity, mellow acidity, and a silky mouthfeel—ready to be enjoyed straight or used as
                the base for lattes, cappuccinos, and other coffee creations.
